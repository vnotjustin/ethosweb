Our world and the communities in which we live are evolving into an increasingly unpredictable and precarious place. This is the realization that inspired us to form Ethos Protection Services Inc. in 2015. From the feedback of many in our community, we saw a need and determined that our combined knowledge and experience can make a positive impact on the safety of our community. Our profound care and concern come not only because we love our valley, but because this is our family's home too. It&#39;s become a duty and obligation to equip individuals, families, businesses, schools, and churches with the knowledge and training to successfully mitigate and survive the unknown and unpredictable threats of our world. This is our Ethos.

Coming from a family of law enforcement and community service, Sam began working along-side local churches and non-profits in the valley to help them grow their security and safety programs. Training staff members, volunteers and security teams exposed a greater interest and need for safety awareness. In 2011, he started Ethos Firearms &amp; Defensive Training, which merged several passions into one mission of equipping and training people of all backgrounds in areas of personal safety. As a result, Sam has had the pleasure of teaching safety awareness, concealed weapons courses and personal defense classes to people all over the Central Valley. With Ethos Protection Services, he is working to broaden this message and reach a greater segment of the valley that he loves.segment of the valley that he loves.segment of the valley that he loves.
